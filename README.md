# HeaterControlSystem_Project_uplaince
 This project implements a simple heater control system using an ESP32 and DS18B20 temperature sensor on Wokwi. It simulates a heater with an LED and alerts overheating via a buzzer. With the included oled display we can monitor the real time Temparatures of the system and included a Relay module to control the Heater (heating element).
